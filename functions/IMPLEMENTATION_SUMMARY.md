# PaymentDate Sales Report Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented dual sales report functionality that supports both `dueDate` and `paymentDate` queries with legacy data support.

## Problem Solved
- **Legacy orders** had `paymentDate: null` but were marked as `isPaid: true`
- **New requirement**: Generate sales reports filtered by `paymentDate`
- **Challenge**: Maintain backwards compatibility without mass database changes

## Solution Implemented

### Query-Level Filtering Approach
When `date_field=paymentDate` is requested, the system now:

1. **Query 1**: Orders with actual `paymentDate` in the specified date range
2. **Query 2**: Legacy orders where:
   - `paymentDate` is `null`
   - `isPaid` is `true` 
   - `dueDate` falls in the paymentDate range (fallback logic)
3. **Merge**: Combine results from both queries, removing duplicates
4. **Process**: Apply sorting and pagination to merged results

### Files Modified

#### `src/utils/queryParser.js`
- Added detection for `date_field=paymentDate`
- Creates `paymentDateWithFallback` filter instead of regular `dateRange`

#### `src/services/base/serviceFactory.js`
- Added handling for `paymentDateWithFallback` filter
- Implements dual parallel query execution
- Merges and deduplicates results
- Maintains existing sorting and pagination logic

## URL Examples

### PaymentDate Reports (New)
```
/bakeries/{bakeryId}/orders/sales_report?date_field=paymentDate&start_date=2025-09-01T05:00:00.000Z&end_date=2025-10-01T04:59:59.999Z
```

### DueDate Reports (Unchanged)
```
/bakeries/{bakeryId}/orders/sales_report?date_field=dueDate&start_date=2025-08-01T05:00:00.000Z&end_date=2025-09-01T04:59:59.999Z
```

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **dueDate queries**: Work exactly as before  
✅ **Existing functionality**: No changes to SalesReport model or other query types  
✅ **No database changes**: All existing data remains untouched  
✅ **Legacy support**: Old orders with `paymentDate: null` are included in paymentDate reports using `dueDate` fallback  

## Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Orders with actual `paymentDate` 
- ✅ Legacy orders with `paymentDate: null` but `isPaid: true`
- ✅ Mixed scenarios with overlapping date ranges
- ✅ Exclusion of unpaid orders even if `dueDate` matches
- ✅ Continued normal operation of `dueDate` queries

## Benefits

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **No Data Migration**: Legacy orders handled transparently  
3. **Efficient Querying**: Uses Firestore's native parallel queries
4. **Clean Architecture**: Logic isolated to query layer
5. **Future-Proof**: New orders with proper `paymentDate` work seamlessly
